## Data Analytics
Data analytics transforms raw data into actionable insights. It encompasses a variety of techniques, technologies, and methods used to identify trends and solve problems utilizing data. Data analytics may help influence corporate processes, improve decision-making, and drive growth.

### 1. Data Basics

#### The Concept of Data
Data is collected, stored, and analyzed as qualitative or quantitative information in various forms. It can be structured, organized in a specific format, or unstructured. In computing and technology, data is used for insights, decision-making, and problem-solving through data analysis and mining.

#### Basic Data Variable Types
a) Numbers (Integer, Float, and Complex)
b) Boolean
c) String

#### Basic Structures Used in Data Analytics
The data structures differ according to mutability and order. There are so many basic structures when we used it for data analytics. But, in Phyton, the essential data structures that we must know are:

a) Table (DataFrame)

Table creates a Table object for displaying comprehensive data. The data is organized into a grid of rows and columns. Most styles can be applied to headers, columns, rows, or individual cells.

Example:

#Notes
 
The table is from Titanic's Dataset, access the dataset here:  https://github.com/khanshafiira/PythonKnowledge-2/blob/main/Titanic.csv

b) Row

Row is a read-only dictionary-like structure that stores the cell values for a single row. As seen in the sample above, the values can be accessed by using the column name and the standard Python square bracket lookup method. The value of a cell in column 'Age' is obtained as follows: `>>> row['Age']`.

c) Column
Columns is an attribute that allows you to retrieve a DataFrame's column labels. It returns an index object that represents the names of the columns in the dataframe.
